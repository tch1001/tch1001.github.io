We begin with the phenomenology of the\\nU(1) action: we discuss its classical equations of motion, its quantization, and its\\nobservables. We then pass to the nonabelian theory, which we treat in the path integral\\nand canonical formalisms. We pay special attention to the framing of manifolds and\\nknots, as well as to the geometrical structure of the quantum theory.\\nContents\\n1 Introduction and Motivation 2\\n2 Abelian Chern{Simons Theory 3\\n2.1 The Classical Theory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\\n2.2 Path Integral Quantization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\\n2.3 Canonical Quantization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\\n2.4 Topological Bells and Whistles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\\n3 Framing and the Path Integral 12\\n3.1 The Nonabelian Chern{Simons Action . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\\n3.2 The Path Integral at Weak Coupling . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\\n3.3 Regularization and Framing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\\n3.4 Wilson Loops and Commentary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\\n4 Hilbert Space Structure 22\\n4.1 Holomorphic Quantization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\\n4.2 Quantization with Sources . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\\n4.3 Example: Genus Zero . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\\n4.4 Outlook: Surgery and Sources . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28\\n5 Tying Up Loose Ends 29\\n5.1 Broad Recapitulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\\n5.2 Extensions and Connections . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\\nDedicated to the memory of V.

    "Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the mathematical and conceptual framework for contemporary elementary particle physics. It is also a framework used in other areas of theoretical physics, such as condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. In a rather informal sense QFT is the extension of quantum mechanics (QM), dealing with particles, over to fields, i.e. systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. (See the entry on quantum mechanics.) In the last decade QFT has become a more widely discussed topic in philosophy of science, with questions ranging from methodology and semantics to ontology. QFT taken seriously in its metaphysical implications seems to give a picture of the world which is at variance with central classical conceptions of particles and fields, and even with some features of QM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sketches how QFT describes fundamental physics and what the status of QFT is among other theories of physics. Since there is a strong emphasis on those aspects of the theory that are particularly important for interpretive inquiries, it does not replace an introduction to QFT as such. One main group of target readers are philosophers who want to get a first impression of some issues that may be of interest for their own work, another target group are physicists who are interested in a philosophical view upon QFT.\n",

    "The following list of cat breeds includes only domestic cat breeds and domestic and wild hybrids.

    "Inconsistency in a breed classification and naming among registries means that an individual animal may be considered different breeds by different registries (though not necessarily eligible for registry in them all, depending on its exact ancestry). For example, TICA's Himalayan is considered a colorpoint variety of the Persian by the CFA, while the Javanese (or Colorpoint Longhair) is a color variation of the Balinese in both the TICA and the CFA; both breeds are merged (along with the Colorpoint Shorthair) into a single \"mega-breed\", the Colourpoint, by the World Cat Federation (WCF), who have repurposed the name \"Javanese\" for the Oriental Longhair. Also, \"Colo[u]rpoint Longhair\" refers to different breeds in other registries. There are many examples of nomenclatural overlap and differences of this sort. Furthermore, many geographical and cultural names for cat breeds are fanciful selections made by Western breeders to be exotic sounding and bear no relationship to the actual origin of the breeds;[4] the Balinese, Javanese, and Himalayan are all examples of this trend.'''"
