title: Understanding Debian's APT
---

There is something that makes me very curious. When you first run a non-existent command in linux you see

```
$ asdfasdfdasf
asdfasdfdasf: command not found
```
Or the a friendly prompt if it is similar to an existing command
```
$ hello3

Command 'hello3' not found, did you mean:

  command 'hello' from snap hello (2.10)
  command 'hellow' from snap hellow (0.1)
  command 'hello' from deb hello (2.10-2ubuntu2)
  command 'hello' from deb hello-traditional (2.10-5)

See 'snap info <snapname>' for additional versions.
```

However, after you installed it using apt and deleted it using apt, you see a different error message. This can be tested by making a custom package of your own, see this [tutorial](https://earthly.dev/blog/creating-and-hosting-your-own-deb-packages-and-apt-repo/)

```
# Suppose I build my own .deb package using dpkg --build
$ sudo apt install -f hello3.deb 
```
