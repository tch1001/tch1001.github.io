I chose to do riscv today but doing x86 will probably be faster.

# Compiling the RISCV Toolchain
We need to do this to obtain `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc`
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl python3 python3-pip libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev ninja-build git cmake libglib2.0-dev
./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv
sudo make linux # this takes forever
```

# Compiling QEMU
We need to do this to obtain `qemu-system-riscv64`
```
git clone --branch v5.0.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/qemu/qemu
cd qemu
./configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu --disable-docs
make -j8
sudo make install
```

# Compiling xv6
```
cd ../xv6-riscv
TOOLPREFIX=/opt/riscv/bin/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- make qemu
```
If all goes well, you should boot into a shell
```
xv6 kernel is booting

hart 1 starting
hart 2 starting
init: starting sh
$ 
$ ls
.              1 1 1024
..             1 1 1024
README         2 2 2305
```
To exit qemu, press `Ctrl-A X`.

# Debugging xv6
Optionally, run with gdb attached
```
TOOLPREFIX=/opt/riscv/bin/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- make qemu-gdb
```
Then, in another terminal, run
```
/opt/riscv/bin/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gdb
target remote :26000 # or whatever port they said above
continue
Ctrl-C # to send interrupt
break swtch
c
# go back and type something in the shell
```

# Poking the kernel code
## `sh.c` Command Types
I injected the following into `sh.c`.
```
  struct pipecmd *pcmd;
  struct redircmd *rcmd;
  fprintf(2, "tch is here, type = %d\n", cmd->type);

  if(cmd == 0)
    exit(1);
```
Then I recompiled using `make qemu`. The output is
```
$ ls 
tch is here, type = 1
... # rest of output
```
If we look at `sh.c`, we see that `1` corresponds to `EXEC`.
```
#define EXEC  1
#define REDIR 2
#define PIPE  3
#define LIST  4
#define BACK  5
```
- `EXEC` is running any command
- `REDIR` is for redirecting output via `>` to a file 
- `PIPE` is for piping output via `|` to another program
- `LIST` is for a list of commands, separated by `;`
- `BACK` is for running a command in the background using `&`

[Balemarthy Part 5](https://medium.com/@balemarthyvamsi/xv6-deep-dive-part5-8455899670e0) talks about the implementation in detail.

Let's try to implement a few new features following this [Harshal](https://medium.com/@harshalshree03/xv6-implementing-ps-nice-system-calls-and-priority-scheduling-b12fa10494e4) tutorial. We will do that in another post!
