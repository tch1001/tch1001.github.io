Btw, I will *guide* you in setting up SSL for any site for $25 (around 1h meeting online), contact me at [@tch1001](https://t.me/tch1001) and save yourself alot of pain in the ass :)

Today, I will show you how to setup SSL on Kubernetes the manual way. I will be using Traefik as the Ingress Controller and Let's Encrypt as the Certificate Authority.

## Kubernetes Setup
Suppose we have created a service (with accompanying deployment, pods, and all that) called `my-service` and we want to expose it to the internet. 
``` 
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-webserver
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-webserver
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: username/my-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-webserver
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8000
#      nodePort: 30002
  type: ClusterIP
```
We can expose it to the internet by creating an IngressRoute resource. (**Note**: This is not the final version)
```
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: my-ingressroute
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - web
    - websecure
  routes:
    - match: Host(`my.domain.com`)
      priority: 1000
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: my-service
          port: 80
          namespace: my-namespace
```

Then over on your DNS provider, you just need to point `my.domain.com` to your *Traefik* Service's External IP address, which you can obtain using
``` 
> kubectl get svc -A # -A for all namespaces
NAME         TYPE          CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)                   AGE
traefik      LoadBalancer  10.245.211.251   137.184.250.51    80/TCP,8080/TCP,443/TCP   20d
my-service   ClusterIP     10.245.210.243   <none>            80/TCP                    20d
```
Traefik will point to `my-service` through the IngressRoute, and you can check the ingressroutes by going to `http://<traefik-service-ip>:8080/dashboard/#/http/routers`.
After adding a DNS record (**note**: use DNS only first (if you're using Cloudflare), we will get to SSL later) <br> <br>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/dnsrecord.png"/>
Going to `http://my.domain.com` will show you the website (note the **http**, we have not setup SSL yet).

## Setting up SSL
There are 2 different ways I will cover. The first being significantly easier but not without some drawbacks.

### Bless Cloudflare (Flexible SSL)
If you're using cloudflare, you're in luck, because you just need to use "Proxied" instead of "DNS only" and you're done. <br>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/dnsrecord2.png"/>

**Note**: If you run into errors, chances are that caching is the issue. I haven't figured out where this caching occurs exactly. What I do is just create a *new* record, using a different domain name (e.g. `my.domain.com` and `my2.domain.com`).

This is known as a "Flexible SSL Setup", where the SSL is terminated at Cloudflare's edge servers. This means that the traffic between the browser and Cloudflare is encrypted, but the traffic between Cloudflare and your site is not. This is okay for non-security-critical applications like blogs, but is not okay for things that require sensitive traffic like login credentials.  <br><br>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/ssl-flexible.png"/>

This is the easiest way to setup SSL, but another drawback is you will not be able to use HTTP/2, which is a newer version of HTTP that is much faster than HTTP/1.1. This is because Cloudflare does not support HTTP/2 for Flexible SSL. If you want to use HTTP/2, you will need to use a different method.

One upside is that using "Proxied" will hide your server's IP address (increased security), and you can check this by running
``` 
> ping my2.domain.com
PING my2.domain.com (104.21.39.182): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 104.21.39.182: icmp_seq=0 ttl=49 time=84.412 ms
```
`104.21.39.182` is not my IP! It is Cloudflare's IP. 

### Certbot SSL Setup
If you want to use "DNS only" and still have SSL, or you want "Proxied" with Full encryption mode, you need to create a certificate using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). Certbot is a free, open-source tool for automatically using Let's Encrypt certificates on manually-configured HTTPS servers.

Usually, people use certbot because it's very automatic, but in this case I have chosen to manually obtain my certificates and upload it because I want to learn how it works, and have greater control over the process. I have found that when I try to do it automatically using Traefik, there is a lot of fiddling and restarting the services, possibly resulting in downtime.  Through the manual method, you don't need to touch the `my-service` Service, and just need to update the IngressRoutes.

First, you need to install certbot. After that you can run
``` 
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenge dns -d my3.domain.com
```
- `--manual` is required if we want to use the DNS acme challenge.
- `-d my3.domain.com` indicates the domain (leaving it out will prompt you to input it manually).

You will see something like
``` 
Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:
_acme-challenge.my3.domain.com
with the following value:
NaeXRxo_oQnpUzeZQ1xj3mhSGaAJ_NXN0wTcOo-_wdA

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.my3.domain.com.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

Press Enter to Continue
```
You need to create a TXT record with the value `NaeXRxo_oQnpUzeZQ1xj3mhSGaAJ_NXN0wTcOo-_wdA` under `_acme-challenge.my3.domain.com`. Then check using Google Admin Toolbox ([https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.my3.domain.com.]( https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.my3.domain.com.)) whether the TXT record is up. If it is, then press Enter 
``` 
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/my3.domain.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/my3.domain.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2023-06-04.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
```
Now we need to upload it to Kubernetes and let IngressRoute access it. This is done via [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). 
``` 
sudo kubectl create secret generic my-secret \
    --from-file=tls.crt=/etc/letsencrypt/live/my3.domain.com/fullchain.pem \
    --from-file=tls.key=/etc/letsencrypt/live/my3.domain.com/privkey.pem
```
All that remains is to update the IngressRoute. 
```
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: my-ingressroute
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - web
    - websecure
  routes:
    - match: Host(`my3.domain.com`)
      priority: 1000
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: my-service
          port: 80
          namespace: my-namespace
  tls:
    secretName: my-secret
    domains:
    - main: my3.domain.com
```
The ``Host(`my.domain.com`)`` changed to ``Host(`my3.domain.com`)`` and added part is 
```
  tls:
    secretName: my-secret
    domains:
    - main: my3.domain.com
```
Now add the DNS record for `my3.domain.com`, change your encryption mode to "Full" and visit the site and all should be good!

## Common errors

### Too many redirects
Most likely your SSL encryption mode is "Off" in Cloudflare.
### 404
Most likely your SSL encryption mode is "Flexible". Cloudflare is trying to access the non-SSL version of your site while your site is forcing it to use SSL (redirecting it to https, which confuses Cloudflare).
### 502 Bad Gateway
It could also be that your encryption mode is "Full" or "Full (Strict)" but the SSL on your Kubernetes Traefik end is not setup properly. Cloudflare is trying to establish an encrypted connection with Traefik but Traefik can't provide one. Check that your Service is running too (can be done using `NodePort` on Kubernetes, or `port-forward` tunneling).  

### Still not working :(
Try setting up on a different domain name. I know that's dumb but it seems like either the browser or some intermediate server along the way has cached the SSL settings. In other words, when working with SSL, you either get it the first time round or you never get it (because updating the configs don't seem to affect much).

What I do personally is try out a bunch of test domains first, before finding out the process that works for the actual one.

## Renewing 
By manual provisioning method, the certificates will not auto-renew. I will write another blog on this when I have time.
