Here are some disorganised thoughts I have. Mainly for myself, just ignore.

Data is transferred using all the HAM radio methods you know, QPSK or whatever. But anyway each channel will have a certain bandwidth / bitrate.

If two people share one frequency band / channel, how to prevent interference? Circuit methods (taking turns) or Statistical methods (on-demand).

Circuit mode: [Frequency-division multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-division_multiplexing) means subdivide the band up (like radio) and [Time-division multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing) means give each other air time. There are others on wiki. This is bad because if you don't use your allocated slot when it's your turn, it's wasted.

[Statistical multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_time-division_multiplexing): involves queueing theory. [Little's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law) is quite intuitive. Go study M/M/1 queue. Then you can rigorously show that statistical multiplexing is better than TDM (compare expected waiting time). 

[Burke's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke%27s_theorem) basically says departure is Poisson. Web servers can be modelled as [Jackson Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_network)

Queueing theory tells us expected waiting time as a function of bandwidth and data rate. We can have some happiness function (a few different kinds) of waiting time. [Water Filling algorithm]() and [Generalized Process Sharing]()

Modern networks use software defined networking. [Border Gateway Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) feels like something that might be useful in swarm robotics. [Distributed Hash Table]() has algorithms like Chord and CAN. Chord is a ring and CAN is a d-torus.

Copilot: [OpenFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFlow) is a protocol that allows you to control the flow of packets. [Open vSwitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_vSwitch) is a software switch that implements OpenFlow. [Mininet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mininet) is a network emulator that allows you to run a virtual network on your computer. [OpenDaylight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDaylight) is a controller that allows you to control OpenFlow switches. [OpenStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack) is a cloud computing platform that allows you to control OpenFlow switches.

Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) is OR of ANDs. Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) is AND of ORs. Every boolean expresion has a DNF and CNF. Copilot: DNF is useful for satisfiability. CNF is useful for tautology. Useful means there exists a polynomial time algorithm to check it. SAT is NP-complete by Cook Levin. 

Bindary Decision Diagrams are a representation of If-then-else Normal Form (INF). It's basically a decision DAG for whether a boolean expression is true or false. Reduced Ordered BDD (ROBDD) obeys canonicity lemma, which means unique. A homework is to implement ROBDD.

Pattern matching: Rete Algorithm. CLIPS is an implementation. CLIPS can deal with fuzzy logic and uncertainty.

CDCL SAT is big. Read DPLL Algorithm
