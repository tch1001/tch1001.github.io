## Associated Bundles (not precise language, TODO rephrase!)
The reason we introduced the [Ehresmann connection](https://tch1001.github.io/math/physics/qft/gauge%20theory/2023/04/27/ehresmann.html) is because it allows us to talk about "induced connections" (not sure if this is the term but I like to think of it as such). Given an Ehresmann connection on a principal $G$-bundle $P$, it canonically induces a connection on other bundles assocated to this $P$. This includes fibers which are representations of $G$. The specific case we are interested in later is $G=\text{Spin}$ and $\text{rep}(G)=\text{spinor}$, which will give us a connection on the spinor bundle, induced by a connection on the principal spin bundle.

Given a principal $G$-bundle $P\rightarrow M$, and a representation $\rho: G\rightarrow GL(V)$ on $V$. One can create a "$\rho$-bundle" which has fibers isomorphic to the $V$. Formally, this is done by considering the direct product modulo an equivalence relation. Frederic Schuller [lecture 20](https://youtu.be/q2GYZz6q3QI) explains in greater detail which I will not flash out here. 

It is worth noting that there can be many associated bundles, the fiber is not limited to representations. A few examples of interest to us is when $G=\text{Spin}$ and the associated bundle can be 
- $\text{Spin}$-bundle
- Spinor bundle
- $SO$-bundle
- Tangent Frame bundle $FM$
- Tangent bundle $TM$

All of these are considered associated bundles of the $\text{Spin}$-bundle. They share the same gauge group. The idea of spin connection is to use the connection ${\Gamma^i}_{j\rho}$ on the tangent frame bundle (which is just Levi Civita connection) to induce in a natural way (torsion free) a connection on the spinor bundle, which we will show to be

$${\omega_\mu}^{a b}:=e_\nu^a {\Gamma^\nu}_{\sigma \mu} e^{\sigma b}+e_\nu^a \partial_\mu e^{\nu b}$$

## Connection on Tangent Frame Bundle / $GL(d)$-principal bundle
**tldr;** Not all indices of ${\Gamma^i}_{j\mu}$ are the same

I talk about this in much greater detail in the Calculating Christofefl Symbols section of another [post](https://tch1001.github.io/math/physics/qft/gauge%20theory/2023/04/27/ehresmann.html).

In summary, on the tangent frame bundle $LM := F(TM)$, a coordinate chart $$x: \mathcal U \rightarrow \mathbb R^d$$ naturally induces a local section, which allows us to pullback the $\mathfrak g$-valued connnection one-form on $LM$ to a $\mathfrak g$-valued one-form on the base manifold $M$. The christoffel symbols $$\mathbf \Gamma_\mu : TM \rightarrow \mathfrak g$$ transform as follows 

$$\begin{aligned}
{\Gamma^{(2) i}}_{j\rho} dy^\rho &= \frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^k} \left({\Gamma^{(1)k}}_{l\mu}  \frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial y^\rho} dy^\rho \right) \frac{\partial x^l}{\partial y^j} + \frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^k} \frac{\partial}{\partial y^\rho } \left(\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial y^j} \right) dy^\rho\\
\mathbf \Gamma^{(2)}_\rho dy^\rho &= \mathbf\Omega^{-1} \left(\mathbf \Gamma^{(1)}_\mu dx^\mu\right) \mathbf \Omega + \mathbf \Omega^{-1} d \mathbf \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

## Principal $SO(d)$-bundle
Previously we considered the frame bundle of the tangent bundle. If there is a metric structure on the manifold, then we can restrict to the bundle of orthonormal frames. This frame bundle is the principal $SO(d)$-bundle. 

## Principal $\text{Spin}(d)$-bundle

$SO(d)$ has a double cover $\varrho : \text{Spin}(d) \to SO(d)$. We would like to find a principal bundle that is a $\varrho$-equivariant lift (see [Schuller Lec 27](https://youtu.be/Way8FfcMpf0)). 

There is a theorem that says that one can only extend $SO(d)$-bundle to $\text{Spin}(d)$-bundle if the second Stiefel Whitney class vanishes. If an extension can be found, then it's called a [spin structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_structure#Spin_structures_on_Riemannian_manifolds) on $M$.

## Spin connection
The Christoffel symbols are the connection for the tangent frame bundle. We can repeat the same procedure to
