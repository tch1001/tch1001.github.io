## Ehressmann Connection
**tldr;** Connections on Fiber bundles are are specified by vertical bundle-valued one-forms

One might be familiar with the connection as the Christoffel symbols ${\Gamma^\mu}_{\nu\rho}(x)$ or the gauge field $A^\mu(x)$. We will review the idea of [Ehresmann connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehresmann_connection) that unifies these 2 seemingly disparate structures in a more abstract framework. It is essential if we are going to generalize the Levi Civita connection (Christoffel symbols) on the tangent bundle to a spin connection on the spin bundle.

The Ehresmann connection can be defined for any smooth Fiber bundle $\pi: E\rightarrow M$ with smooth fiber $F=\pi^{-1}(m),\ m\in M$. If we consider tangent bundle $d\pi: TE \rightarrow TM$, one can see that $\dim T_{(m,f)} TE = \dim E = \dim M + \dim F = \dim T_m M + \dim F$, which implies that $\dim \ker d\pi = \dim F$. Intuitively, the tangent bundle $TP$ has some linear subspace that are "along $F$", and this leads to the definition of $$VE := \ker(d\pi: TE \rightarrow TM)$$
One can look for another subspace that is complementary to $VE$, i.e. 
$$TE = VE \oplus HE$$
The intuition is that vectors in $HE$ point in a direction that leads to **another fiber**, while vectors in $VE$ point in a direction **tangent** to the **current fiber**. I would love to add a diagram showing an example with $\dim M = \dim F = 1$ (the only intuitive diagram one can draw in my opinion).

 In the absence of any additional structure, there are many valid choices of $HE$. This is analogous to saying that the vector space of degree 2 polynomials $\text{span} (1,x,x^2)$ can be decomposed in many ways
 $$
 \begin{aligned}
 \text{span} (1,x,x^2) &= \text{span} (1) \oplus \text{span} (x,x^2)\\
 \text{span} (1,x,x^2) &= \text{span} (1) \oplus \text{span} (5x+x^2, 2x^2)
 \end{aligned}
 $$

### Connection Form
Instead of saying we provide a horizontal subspace at every tangent space of the the tangent bundle $TE$, it is an equivalent definition to just provide a projection map 
$$\Phi : TE \rightarrow VE$$
from which $HE = \ker \Phi $ can be inferred.

 **Punchline**: One can say that $\Phi$ is a $VE$-valued one-form on $E$ since it takes a vector in $TE$ and gives an element of $VE$. 

### Ehressmann Connection on $G$-bundle

**tldr;** Connection on $G$-bundle $P$ is a Lie algebra-valued one-form on $TP$

If we consider $E$ to be a principal $G$-bundle $P$, then the $\Phi:TE\rightarrow VE$ is a Lie group-valued one-form. Since $VE$ consists of vectors that live in the tangent space $T_{(m,g)} E$ that have the same dimension as $\dim G$, the vertical subspace $V_{(m,g)}E \cong T_g G \cong T_e G \cong \mathfrak{g}$ is isomorphic to the Lie algebra. So the connection $\Phi$ on a $G$-bundle is specified by a Lie algebra-valued one-form **on P** (the full bundle $P\rightarrow M$). 

However, it turns out that given a local trivialization $\mathcal{U}\times G$ of $P \rightarrow M$, specifying a Lie algebra-valued one-form $\omega^\mathcal{U} : T\mathcal{U}\rightarrow \mathfrak{g}$ on $M$ actually specifies enough information to specify $\Phi$ on the full bundle $P$. This might seem wild at first since surely projecting $\Phi$ onto $M$ to yield $\omega$ will lose information with regard to how this one form behaves on the fibers. The answer is that the condition that there is an action of $G$ on the fibers $G$ is constraining enough to reconstruct $\Phi$ given $\omega$. These $\omega^\mathcal{U}$ are known as the Yang-Mills fields. There are alot of details that are covered in the [excellent lecture 22 by Frederic Schuller](https://youtu.be/KhagmmNvOvQ).

## Associated Bundles
The reason we introduced the Ehresmann connection is because it allows us to talk about "induced connections" (not sure if this is the term but I like to think of it as such). Given an Ehresmann connection on a principal $G$-bundle $P$, it canonically induces a connection on other bundles assocated to this $P$. This includes fibers which are representations of $G$. The specific case we are interested in later is $G=\text{Spin}$ and $\text{rep}(G)=\text{spinor}$, which will give us a connection on the spinor bundle, induced by a connection on the spin bundle, which is induced by the Levi Civita connection (related to $SO$-bundle and frame bundle).

Given a principal $G$-bundle $P\rightarrow M$, and a representation $\rho: G\rightarrow GL(V)$ on $V$. One can create a "$\rho$-bundle" which has fibers isomorphic to the $V$. Formally, this is done by considering the direct product modulo an equivalence relation. Frederic Schuller [lecture 20](https://youtu.be/q2GYZz6q3QI) explains in greater detail which I will not flash out here. It is worth noting that there can be many representations $\rho$. An example of interest to us is when $G=\text{Spin}$ and $\rho$ can be 
- $\text{Spin}$-bundle
- Spinor bundle
- $SO$-bundle
- Frame bundle
- Tangent bundle

All of these are considered associated bundles of one another. They share the same gauge group. The idea of spin connection is to use the connection ${\Gamma^\mu}_{\nu\rho}$ on the tangent bundle (which is just Levi Civita connection) to define in a natural way (torsion free) a connection on the spinor bundle $${\omega_\mu}^{a b}:=e_\nu^a {\Gamma^\nu}_{\sigma \mu} e^{\sigma b}+e_\nu^a \partial_\mu e^{\nu b}$$

## Tangent Bundle 

## Connection on Tangent Bundle
Not all indices of $\Gamma$ are the same

## Frame Bundle

## Principal $SO$-bundle

## Principal $\text{Spin}$-bundle
One can only extend $SO$-bundle to $\text{Spin}$-bundle if the Stiefel Whitney class vanishes or something. This is called spin structure
