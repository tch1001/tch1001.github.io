## Associated Bundles (not precise language, TODO rephrase!)
The reason we introduced the Ehresmann connection is because it allows us to talk about "induced connections" (not sure if this is the term but I like to think of it as such). Given an Ehresmann connection on a principal $G$-bundle $P$, it canonically induces a connection on other bundles assocated to this $P$. This includes fibers which are representations of $G$. The specific case we are interested in later is $G=\text{Spin}$ and $\text{rep}(G)=\text{spinor}$, which will give us a connection on the spinor bundle, induced by a connection on the principal spin bundle.

Given a principal $G$-bundle $P\rightarrow M$, and a representation $\rho: G\rightarrow GL(V)$ on $V$. One can create a "$\rho$-bundle" which has fibers isomorphic to the $V$. Formally, this is done by considering the direct product modulo an equivalence relation. Frederic Schuller [lecture 20](https://youtu.be/q2GYZz6q3QI) explains in greater detail which I will not flash out here. 

It is worth noting that there can be many associated bundles, the fiber is not limited to representations. A few examples of interest to us is when $G=\text{Spin}$ and the associated bundle can be 
- $\text{Spin}$-bundle
- Spinor bundle
- $SO$-bundle
- Frame bundle
- Tangent bundle

All of these are considered associated bundles of the $\text{Spin}$-bundle. They share the same gauge group. The idea of spin connection is to use the connection ${\Gamma^\mu}_{\nu\rho}$ on the tangent bundle (which is just Levi Civita connection) to induce in a natural way (torsion free) a connection on the spinor bundle, which we will show to be
$${\omega_\mu}^{a b}:=e_\nu^a {\Gamma^\nu}_{\sigma \mu} e^{\sigma b}+e_\nu^a \partial_\mu e^{\nu b}$$

## Tangent Bundle 

## Connection on Tangent Bundle
**tldr;** Not all indices of ${\Gamma^i}_{j\mu}$ are the same

## Frame Bundle

## Principal $SO$-bundle

## Principal $\text{Spin}$-bundle
One can only extend $SO$-bundle to $\text{Spin}$-bundle if the Stiefel Whitney class vanishes or something. This is called spin structure
