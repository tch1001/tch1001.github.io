## Ehressmann Connection
**tldr;** Connections on Fiber bundles are are specified by vertical bundle-valued one-forms

One might be familiar with the connection as the Christoffel symbols ${\Gamma^\mu}_{\nu\rho}(x)$ or the gauge field $A^\mu(x)$. We will review the idea of [Ehresmann connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehresmann_connection) that unifies these 2 seemingly disparate structures in a more abstract framework. It is essential if we are going to generalize the Levi Civita connection (Christoffel symbols) on the tangent bundle to a spin connection on the spin bundle.

The Ehresmann connection can be defined for any smooth Fiber bundle $\pi: E\rightarrow M$ with smooth fiber $F=\pi^{-1}(m),\ m\in M$. If we consider tangent bundle $d\pi: TE \rightarrow TM$, one can see that $\dim T_{(m,f)} TE = \dim E = \dim M + \dim F = \dim T_m M + \dim F$, which implies that $\dim \ker d\pi = \dim F$. Intuitively, the tangent bundle $TP$ has some linear subspace that are "along $F$", and this leads to the definition of $$VE := \ker(d\pi: TE \rightarrow TM)$$
One can look for another subspace that is complementary to $VE$, i.e. 
$$TE = VE \oplus HE$$
The intuition is that vectors in $HE$ point in a direction that leads to **another fiber**, while vectors in $VE$ point in a direction **tangent** to the **current fiber**. I would love to add a diagram showing an example with $\dim M = \dim F = 1$ (the only intuitive diagram one can draw in my opinion).

 In the absence of any additional structure, there are many valid choices of $HE$. This is analogous to saying that the vector space of degree 2 polynomials $\text{span} (1,x,x^2)$ can be decomposed in many ways
 $$
 \begin{aligned}
 \text{span} (1,x,x^2) &= \text{span} (1) \oplus \text{span} (x,x^2)\\
 \text{span} (1,x,x^2) &= \text{span} (1) \oplus \text{span} (5x+x^2, 2x^2)
 \end{aligned}
 $$

### Connection Form
Instead of saying we provide a horizontal subspace at every tangent space of the the tangent bundle $TE$, it is an equivalent definition to just provide a projection map 
$$\Phi : TE \rightarrow VE$$
from which $HE = \ker \Phi $ can be inferred.

 **Punchline**: One can say that $\Phi$ is a $VE$-valued one-form on $E$ since it takes a vector in $TE$ and gives an element of $VE$. 

### Ehressmann Connection on $G$-bundle

**tldr;** Connection on $G$-bundle $P$ is a Lie algebra-valued one-form on $TP$

If we consider $E$ to be a principal $G$-bundle $P$, then the $\Phi:TE\rightarrow VE$ is a Lie group-valued one-form. Since $VE$ consists of vectors that live in the tangent space $T_{(m,g)} E$ that have the same dimension as $\dim G$, the vertical subspace $V_{(m,g)}E \cong T_g G \cong T_e G \cong \mathfrak{g}$ is isomorphic to the Lie algebra. So the connection $\Phi$ on a $G$-bundle is specified by a Lie algebra-valued one-form **on P** (the full bundle $P\rightarrow M$). 

However, it turns out that given a local trivialization $\mathcal{U}\times G$ of $P \rightarrow M$, specifying a Lie algebra-valued one-form $\omega^\mathcal{U} : T\mathcal{U}\rightarrow \mathfrak{g}$ on $M$ actually specifies enough information to specify $\Phi_\mathcal{U}$ on $\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{U})$, which is then glued together with other charts to obtain $\Phi$ on the full bundle $P$. This might seem wild at first since surely projecting $\Phi$ onto $M$ to yield $\omega$ will lose information with regard to how this one form behaves on the fibers. The answer is that the condition that there is an action of $G$ on the fibers $G$ is constraining enough to reconstruct $\Phi$ given $\omega$. These $\omega^\mathcal{U}$ are known as the Yang-Mills fields. There are alot of details that are covered in the [excellent lecture 22 by Frederic Schuller](https://youtu.be/KhagmmNvOvQ).

### Details of Theorem
The main result is a theorem 
- presented at 21:28 of Schuller Lecture 22 (I follow his notation)
- Theorem 10.1 in Nakahara
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(principal_bundle)#Pull_back_via_trivializing_section)

Given a section $\sigma:\mathcal U \rightarrow P$ which induces canonical local trivialization $h:\mathcal{U}\times G \rightarrow P$, a $\mathfrak g$-valued one-form $\omega$ on $P$ can be pulled back via $\sigma$ or $h$. 

The $\sigma^* \omega$ pullback induces the $h^*\omega$ pullback by the following definition
$$ h^* \omega_{(m,g)}(v,\gamma) := (\text{Ad}_{g^{-1}})_* ((\sigma^* \omega) (v)) + (L_{g^{-1}})_* (\gamma)$$
where $v\in T_m \mathcal U,\ \gamma \in T_g G$.

Theorem: This $h^* \omega$ satisfies the 2 properties of a connection, namely
- $(h^* \omega)(h^{-1}_* A^\#) = A$
- $(R_g^* (h^* \omega))(h^{-1}_* X) = \text{Ad}_{g^{-1}*} (h^*\omega (h^{-1}_* X))$ 

where $A \in \mathfrak g$ and $A^\#:P\rightarrow TP$ is the fundamental vector field on $P$ generated by $A$, defined pointwise as 
$$\ A^\#_{p\in P} := \left.\frac{d}{dt} R_{\exp(tA)} (p) \right\vert_{t=0} \in V_pP \subset T_pP$$

Proof of $(h^* \omega)(h^{-1}_* A^\#) = A$:

Since $A^\# \in V_p P$, the pushforward via $h$ yields $h_* A^\# = (0, \gamma) \in T_m \mathcal U \times T_g G$, where $\gamma$ is 
$$\gamma =\left. \frac{d}{dt}  g \exp (tA) \right\vert_{t=0} $$ 
where $(m,g) = h^{-1} (p)$. It is clear from this that $(L_{g^{-1}})_*\gamma = A$.

This condition is basically saying that the inverse pullback $h^{-1*} h^* \omega = \omega$ satisfies the connection one-form condition $\omega (A^\#) = A$.

Proof of $(R_g^* (h^* \omega))(h^{-1}_* X) = \text{Ad}_{g^{-1}*} (h^*\omega (h^{-1}_* X))$: 

To prove this, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{LHS} & = (R_k^* (h^* \omega))(h^{-1}_* X) \\
 & = h^* \omega( R_{k*} h^{-1}_* X )\\
& = (h^* \omega)_{(m, gk)}(v, R_{k*} \gamma) \\
& = \text{Ad}_{(gk)^{-1}*} (\sigma^* \omega(v)) + L_{(gk)^{-1} * R_{k*} \gamma } \\
& = \text{Ad}_{k^{-1}*}\text{Ad}_{g^{-1}*}(\sigma^* \omega(v)) + L_{k^{-1}*} R_{k*} L_{g^{-1}*}\gamma \\ 
& = \text{Ad}_{k^{-1}*} \left( \text{Ad}_{g^{-1}*}(\sigma^* \omega(v)) + L_{g^{-1}*}\gamma \right) \\ 
& = \text{Ad}_{k^{-1}*} \left( h^* \omega(h^{-1}_* X)  \right) \\ 
& = \text{RHS}
\end{aligned}
$$

So the above calculations has shown that given a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued one-form $\omega^\mathcal{U}$ on $\mathcal{U}$ and a section $\sigma:\mathcal U \rightarrow \pi^{-1}(\mathcal U)$, there exists a unique connection one-form $\omega$ on $\pi^{-1}(\mathcal U)$ such that $\omega^\mathcal{U} = \sigma^* \omega$. The constructed connection depends on $\sigma$.
<!-- In other words, specifying the $\mathfrak g$-valued one-form on the base space $M$ is enough information to uniquely construct the full connection on $P \rightarrow M$.  -->

$\Leftarrow$ construction: Split $P$ into charts $\mathcal U ^ i$. Then each local trivialization induces a section $\sigma_i : M \rightarrow P$. The pullback of $\omega$ on $P$ via $\sigma_i$ will give an $\omega^\mathcal{U_i}$ on $\mathcal{U}_i$, which is a Yang-mills field $\omega^M$ on the base manifold $M$ after gluing. The gluing is what we call "gauge transformations of $A$" or "how $\Gamma$ transforms under change in coordinates".

$\Rightarrow$ construction: Split $P$ into charts $\mathcal U^i$. On each chart, the one-form $\omega^{\mathcal U^i}$ on $\mathcal U^i$ induces a one-form (which is actually $h^* \omega$) on the local trivialisation $h$ of $\pi^{-1}(\mathcal U^i)$ via the theorem above. These $h^*\omega$ can be glued together to construct a one-form $\omega$ on $P$.

### Clearing the Ambiguity in Nakahara's Notation
I learned alot from Nakahara's book, but I find their section on connection one-form slightly ambiguous. For the connection one-form on $P$, they write
$$\omega_i \equiv g_i^{-1}\pi^* \mathcal A_i g_i + g_i^{-1} dg_i$$
where $\mathcal A_i$ is the Yang Mills one-form on the base manifold $M$. 
The first term $g^{-1}_i \pi^* \mathcal A_i g_i$ actually means
$$\text{Ad}_{g_i^{-1}*} (\pi^* \mathcal A_i(X))$$
where $\text{Ad}_{g_i^{-1}*}: T_e G \rightarrow T_e G$ is the adjoint action of $G$ on $\mathfrak g$, and $X\in T_p \mathcal P$. The $\text{Ad}_{g^{-1}*}(Y)$ and $g^{-1} Y g,\ Y \in \mathfrak g$ notations coincide for matrix Lie groups, where the multiplication between $g$ and $Y$ is matrix multiplication. I still prefer to talk purely in non-matrix notation because I find it's clearer.

Because $X = H + V$ and $V \in \ker \pi^*$, the above actually reduces to
$$\text{Ad}_{g_i^{-1}*} (\mathcal A_i(v))$$ 
where $v\in T_m \mathcal U^i \cong H_p P$ is a horizontal vector. The first term takes care of the vertical component of $X$.

The second term is extremely ambiguous. $g_i^{-1}$ is simply just $L_{g^{-1}*}$. Trouble comes from $dg_i$. Usually one uses $dg$ to denote the pushforward of $g$. But in this case, $dg$ actually means $\gamma \in V_p P \cong T_g G$. If I include the implicit annotations, 
$${\omega_i}_{(m,g)} (X) \equiv \text{Ad}_{g_i^{-1}*} (\mathcal A_i(\text{hor}(X))) + L_{g^{-1}*} (\text{ver}(X))$$
So how does one justify $dg = \gamma$? $g$ is interpreted as a map $\mathbb R \rightarrow G$ in the local trivialization $h^{-1}(p) = (m,g)$. A vector is the derivative of a curve at one point of the curve, so given a curve $C$ in $P$ which leads to vector $X=\frac{dC}{dt}$, we actually mean to define
$$dg \equiv \frac{d}{dt} g(C(t)) \in V_p P$$
i.e. derivative of the $G$ fiber "coordinate" of our curve $C(t)=(m(t),g(t))$. $dg:TM\rightarrow VP $ is the pushforward of the map $g:M\rightarrow P$. So $dg(\pi^*X ) = \text{ver}(X)$.

**tldr;** $dg$ is $\text{ver} (X)$.

## Gluing of Connection One-Form
Given 2 overlapping local trivializations $\mathcal U^i \cap \mathcal U^j$ (which induces 2 local sections $\sigma_i, \sigma_j : \mathcal U^i \cap \mathcal U^j \rightarrow P$), we would like to find how $\sigma_{i}^* \omega$ is related to $\sigma_{j}^* \omega$. The answer is obtained by investigating how they act on a vector $X \in T_{m} (\mathcal U^i \cap \mathcal U^j)$. We need to calculate $\sigma_{i*} X \in T_{\sigma_i(m)} P $ in terms of $\sigma_{j*} X \in T_{\sigma_j(m)} P$. Or in terms of the local trivialisation ${(h_i \circ \sigma_i)}_{*} X \in T_{(m, e_i)} \mathcal U^i \times G$ and ${(h_j \circ\sigma_j)}_{*} X \in T_{(m, e_j)} \mathcal U^j \times G$. 

We know that $t_{ij}: \mathcal U^i \cap \mathcal U^j \rightarrow G$ is the transition map defined as the unique (guaranteed since $G$ acts freely and transitively on the fibers of $P$) element $t_{ij}(m) \in G$ such that 
$$R_{t_{ij}(m)}(p) = h_j \circ h_i^{-1}(p)$$ 
This definition can be rephrased in a more friendly manner as 
$$
\begin{aligned}
h_i^{-1}(p) = &\ h_j^{-1}(p) \bullet_R t_{ij}(m) \\
\text{Denoting } h^{-1}(p) := &\ (m, g(p)) \text{ ,}\\
g_i(p) = &\ g_j(p) \bullet_G t_{ij}(m) 
\end{aligned}
$$
Repeating the derivation with $i \leftrightarrow j$ swapped, we get that $t_{ij} = t_{ji}^{-1}$

If we let $p=\sigma_j(m)$, then the last equation becomes
$$g_i(\sigma_j(m)) = e \bullet_G t_{ij}(m) = t_{ij}(m)$$
which translates the definition into a statement about transition maps between sections

$$\sigma_j(m) = \sigma_i(m) \bullet_R t_{ij}(m)$$

Suppose we have a curve $\gamma(t)$ in $M$ that yields the vector $T_m M \ni X = \frac{d\gamma}{dt} \vert_{t=0}$ at $m:=\gamma(0)$. This vector acts on a function $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb R$. The pushforward is given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{j*}(X)(f) & = \left. \frac{d}{dt} f[\sigma_j (\gamma (t))] \right\vert_{t=0} \\
& = \left. \frac{d}{dt} f[\sigma_i(\gamma(t)) \bullet_R t_{ij}(\gamma(t))] \right\vert_{t=0}\\
& = \left. \frac{d}{dt} f[\sigma_i(\gamma(t))\bullet_R t_{ij}(m)] \right\vert_{t=0} + \left. \frac{d}{dt} f[\sigma_i(m) \bullet_R t_{ij}(\gamma(t))] \right\vert_{t=0} \\
& = \left. \frac{d}{dt} (f \circ R_{t_{ij}(m)})[\sigma_i(\gamma(t))] \right\vert_{t=0} 
+ \left. \frac{d}{dt} f[\sigma_i(m) \bullet_R \exp(\log t_{ij}(\gamma(t)))] \right\vert_{t=0} \\
& = \left( \left. \frac{d}{dt} \sigma_i(\gamma(t)) \right\vert_{t=0} \right) (f \circ  R_{t_{ij}(m)})
+ (\log t_{ij}(m))^\#_{\sigma_i(m)} f\\
& = R_{t_{ij}(m)*}\left( \left. \frac{d}{dt} \sigma_i(\gamma(t)) \right\vert_{t=0} \right) f 
+ \left(L_{t_{ij}^{-1}*} \left. \frac{d}{dt} t_{ij}(\gamma(t)) \right\vert_{t=0} \right)^\#_{\sigma_i(m) \bullet_R t_{ij}(m)} f\\
& = R_{t_{ij}(m)*} \sigma_{i*} \left( \left. \frac{d}{dt} \gamma(t) \right\vert_{t=0} \right) f 
+ \left(L_{t_{ij}^{-1}*} t_{ij*}\left. \frac{d}{dt} \gamma(t) \right\vert_{t=0} \right)^\#_{\sigma_j(m)} f\\
& = (R_{t_{ij}(m)*} \sigma_{i*} X) f + \left(L_{t_{ij}^{-1}*} t_{ij*} X \right)^\#_{\sigma_j(m)} f \\
& = \left(R_{t_{ij}(m)*} \sigma_{i*} X + \left(L_{t_{ij}^{-1}*} t_{ij*} X \right)^\#_{\sigma_j(m)} \right) f \\
\end{aligned}
$$
so the vector fields are related as follows
$$\sigma_{j*}X = R_{t_{ij}*} (\sigma_{i*} X) + \left(L_{t_{ij}^{-1}*} t_{ij*} X\right)^\# $$

Note that each term is responsible for the horizontal $H$ and vertical $V$ component of the vector $X=H+V$. Right $G$-invariance of the horizontal bundle $R_{t_{ij}*} : H_{\sigma_i(m)} P \rightarrow H_{\sigma_j(m)} P$ means horizontal gets mapped onto horizontal. The $Y^\#$ vector field generated from an element $Y$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ lives in the vertical bundle too, so vertical maps onto vertical.

This allows us to relate $\sigma_i^* \omega$ to $\sigma_j^* \omega$, which is what we call "gauge transformations" of $\mathcal A$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{j}^* \omega (X) & = \omega(\sigma_{j*} X)\\
& = \omega(R_{t_{ij}*}(\sigma_{i*}X) + \omega\left((L_{t_{ij}^{-1}*} t_{ij*} X)^\# \right) \\ 
& = (R^*_{t_{ij}} \omega)(\sigma_{i*} X) + L_{t_{ij}^{-1}*} t_{ij*} X \\
& = \text{Ad}_{t^{-1}_{ij}*} (\omega(\sigma_{i*}X)) + L_{t_{ij}^{-1}*} t_{ij*} X \\
& = \text{Ad}_{t^{-1}_{ij}*} (\sigma_{i}^* \omega(X)) + L_{t_{ij}^{-1}*} t_{ij*} X \\
\end{aligned}
$$
So this is the mathematically precise expression for the $A \mapsto g^{-1} A g + g^{-1} d g$
