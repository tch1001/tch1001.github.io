title: "Recovering Postgresql Password using Sidecar Container"
categories: [Kubernetes, Docker, Devops]
---
Recently I lost my postgresql password while doing `helm install bitnami/postgresq`. Let's try to recover it.

One can recover the password via [this procedure](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-administration/postgresql-reset-password/). However, the issue at hand is that I cannot use `vim` or `nano` in the container.

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it myapp-postgresql-0 -- bash
$ vim
bash: vim: command not found
$ nano
bash: nano: command not found
```

Even worse, I can't `apt update` without `sudo`

```bash
$ apt update
E: List directory /var/lib/apt/lists/partial is missing 
$ sudo apt update
bash: sudo: command not found
```

I could try really hard to install `vim` manually, but let's try something smarter. Usually containers really contain the bare minimum to run the service, making debugging hard due to the absence of common linux tools. We can get around this by understanding that in kubernetes, pods can have many containers. We can inject a [sidecar container](https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/kubernetes-learn-sidecar-container-pattern-6d8c21f873d) that contains all the debugging tools. They will have access to the same networking and volume mounts (if configured properly).

A naive attempt to `kubectl edit pod` and inject a sidecar container yields the error

```bash
spec.containers forbidden pod updates may not add or remove containers
```

## Setting up Backup
We need to make some changes to the `postgresql-rendered.yaml` file. 

### Sidecar Container
```
k get secret # GET PASSWORD OUT FIRST (see above section)
k delete -f postgresql-rendered.yaml
vim postgresql-rendered.yaml
# add a new (sidecar) container to the pod
      containers:
# =========== add this part in ===========
        - image: ubuntu
          command: ["/bin/sh"]
          args: ["-c", "tail -f /dev/null"]
          name: sidecar-container1
          resources: {}
          volumeMounts:
            - name: data # existing volume mount below
              mountPath: /bitnami/postgresql
# ========================================
        - name: postgresql
      ... rest of postgresql container ...
```
Then reapply the file and check that the sidecar container is running
```
k apply -f postgresql-rendered.yaml
k get pod
```
Upon successful launch, `k exec` into the sidecar container
```
k exec svc/main-postgresql -it -c sidecar-container1 -- bash
> apt update && apt install -y vim
> vim /bitnami
```
