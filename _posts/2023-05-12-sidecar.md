title: "Recovering Postgresql Password using Sidecar Container"
categories: [Kubernetes, Docker, Devops]
---
Recently I lost my postgresql password while doing `helm install bitnami/postgresq`. Let's try to recover it.

One can recover the password via [this procedure](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-administration/postgresql-reset-password/). However, the issue at hand is that I cannot use `vim` or `nano` in the container.

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it myapp-postgresql-0 -- bash
$ vim
bash: vim: command not found
$ nano
bash: nano: command not found
```

Even worse, I can't `apt update` without `sudo`

```bash
$ apt update
E: List directory /var/lib/apt/lists/partial is missing 
$ sudo apt update
bash: sudo: command not found
```

I could try really hard to install `vim` manually, but let's try something smarter. Usually containers really contain the bare minimum to run the service, making debugging hard due to the absence of common linux tools. We can get around this by understanding that in kubernetes, pods can have many containers. We can inject a [sidecar container](https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/kubernetes-learn-sidecar-container-pattern-6d8c21f873d) that contains all the debugging tools. They will have access to the same networking and volume mounts (if configured properly).

A naive attempt to `kubectl edit pod` and inject a sidecar container yields the error

```bash
spec.containers forbidden pod updates may not add or remove containers
```
