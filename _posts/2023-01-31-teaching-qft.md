title: Teaching Quantum Field Theory
categories: [Physics, QFT]
---
I've started trying to teach quantum field theory casually. The lessons take place roughly fortnightly (every [Sunday 8pm](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TCH%27s+QFT+Lectures&iso=20230129T20&p1=%3A&ah=2) on Zoom). [Contact](https://www.tchlabs.net/#contact) me on telegram to sit in! Hopefully I can get enough practice and refine my material such that when I am actually required to teach QFT in a university, I will be confident enough to be a good lecturer!

Here are the [slides](/downloads/TanChienHao_Slides.pdf)
and [recordings](https://youtube.com/) (TODO to be uploaded).

Special thanks to [Victoris.org](https://victoris.org/) for supporting my lessons!
