title: Topological Twisting of Supersymmetry
categories: [Physics, QFT, Supersymmetry]

This is guide on how to perform topological twists that we often see in hep-th models. One might have difficulty coming across good resources with the "SUSY twist" keyword, and that is because this is actually a subject in "Topological String Theory", and good resources include [Vonk's mini course](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0504147), [Mirror Symmetry book](https://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Symmetry-Clay-Mathematics-Monographs/dp/0821829556) chapter 16. We assume basic [supersymmetry](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/susy.html) knowledge. The idea originated from [Witten](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01466725) in his 1988 paper on topological sigma models. And I have also made a podcast [episode](https://youtu.be/6lpmmTGP9PU) on this. We will try to go through the concept before learning through a few prominent examples.
