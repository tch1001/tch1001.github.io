title: Koszul Connection and Covariant Derivative
categories: [Math, Physics, QFT, Gauge Theory]

As part 2 of my series building towards "Twisting Supersymmetry" (see [part 1 here](https://tch1001.github.io/math/physics/qft/gauge%20theory/2023/04/27/ehresmann.html)), I will talk about connections on associated bundles induced by connections on principal bundle. We actually see this very often: $U(1)$ gauge theory (electromagnetism) will often have a scalar field (scalar QED) or a Dirac spinor field (QED) charged under $U(1)$. If one inspects the covariant derivative in scalar QED, it actually arises from the connection on the complex line bundle ($\mathbb C$-bundle) induced by the connection on the $U(1)$-principal bundle. And for QED, it is the connection on the $K \oplus \bar K$ vector bundle (Dirac spinor bundle) induced by the connection on the $U(1)$-principal bundle.
