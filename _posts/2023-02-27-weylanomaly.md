title: Why $D=26$ in Bosonic String Theory
Categories: [Physics, String Theory, QFT]

I am taking a string theory module in NUS this semester. For my midterms, I have prepared a [presentation](/downloads/weylanomaly.pdf) explains the why bosonic string theory needs 26 dimensions for "the math to make sense". Enjoy!

Abstract:
In summary, to quantise the Polyakov action for a bosonic string,
we had to insert the Faddeev-Popov determinant into the path
integral, which ended up being calculated by the bc ghost CFT. bc
CFT alone had central charge of −26, but we need the total
central charge of Polyakov + bc to be 0 due to the Weyl anomaly.
So the Polyakov action needed to have a ”critical central charge”
of 26, which corresponded to the coordinates of the string being
26-dimensional. 

There are other ways to derive the critical dimension, such as using Lorentz invariance.
