title: Fun with QEMU Arguments and Character Devices
---
If you do `man qemu-system` and search for `-serial` you would come across a good explanation of how the `qemu` terminal emulation works. Let's have abit of fun with it.

# Playing with Character Devices
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ./vmlinux 
```
pops up a window with a few tabs, `VGA`, `compat_monitor0`, `serial0`, `parallel0` (Ctrl-Alt M > View > Show Tabs)

- `VGA` is what you would see if you connected a monitor to the system you are booting up.
- `compat_monitor0` is the qemu monitor that you can use to interact with the qemu instance. `(qemu)`. You can type `help` to see the commands you can use.
- `serial0` and `parallel0` are buses or channels of communication between the host and the emulated qemu instance. I like to think of parallel as the 64-bit bus and serial as RX/TX UART communication. 

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ./vmlinux -append "console=ttyS0 meowmeow"
```
Just like how you can parse arguments into an executable like `./a.out param1 param2`, you can also parse arguments into `./vmlinux` (just that you can't execute it directly and need to use qemu or boot it from a bootloader). In this case we pass an argument `console=ttyS0` to tell the kernel to use `ttyS0` as the console. We also pass `meowmeow` as an argument, which is just a random marker I will find in the kernel logs (when we log to a file). For now you see a lot of stuff spew out in the `serial0` tab.

You could try other consoles too listed [here](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/serial-console.html). I tried putting a funny Baud rate but nothing happened. 

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ./vmlinux -append "console=ttyS0" -serial file:serial.log 
cat serial.log # see kernel boot logs
cat serial.log | grep meowmeow
[    0.000000] Command line: console=ttyS0 meowmeow
[    0.058980] Kernel command line: console=ttyS0 meowmeow
[    0.059534] Unknown kernel command line parameters "meowmeow", will be passed to user space.
```
You can specify many `-serial` flags, it would correspond to `serial0`, `serial1`, etc. After each `-serial`, you specify a character device, which could be many things. In this example, we chose a write-only chardev which writes to a file. Read the `man` page or `-chardev help` to see all options.

We also observe that whatever we parse into `-append` gets sent to the kernel file `vmlinux`. So it comes as no surprise later we send things like `console=ttyS0 panic=1 root=/dev/sda rootfstype=ext2`. Basically just telling the kernel what to do when it panics and how to work with the emulated hardware we pass it. 

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ./vmlinux -append "console=ttyS0" -serial file:serial.log -chardev file,path=mon.log,mux=on,id=char0 -mon chardev=char0,mode=readline
```
This binds the file `mon.log` to the qemu monitor. When we open it up, we see 
```
$ cat mon.log
QEMU 4.2.1 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu)
```

Practically speaking, it doesn't make sense to bind a monitor interactive console to a write-only file. So let's bind it to `stdio` instead.

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -chardev stdio,id=char0 -mon chardev=char0,mode=readline -kernel ./vmlinux -append "console=ttyS0"
```
In the graphical window, open the `serial0` tab. Then in the monitor, you can play around
```
(qemu) info chardev
parallel0: filename=vc
char0: filename=stdio
serial0: filename=vc
(qemu) system_reset
(qemu) stop
(qemu) cont
```

If you don't like the kernel logs to appear in graphical window, you can bind `-serial chardev:char0` too. Now you can cycle between `compat-monitor0` and `serial0` using `C-A C`.

If we do this to `-parallel 0` (which is currently blank anyway), and also do `-display none`. Then we have effectively done `-nographic` ourselves using:

```
NOGRAPHIC="-chardev stdio,mux=on,id=char0 -mon chardev=char0,mode=readline -serial chardev:char0 -parallel chardev:char0 -display none"
```

Here are some differences, but please DO NOT use `$NOGRAPHIC` because I found it causes later issues with the shell (busybox segfault). Just use `-nographic` and treat `$NOGRAPHIC` like an academic curiosity.
| `-nographic`      | `$NOGRAPHIC` |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| messes up wrapping (fixed with `reset`) | doesn't |
| prints VGA stuff to console ("Booting from ROM") | doesn't        |
| works with shell | doesn't (OH NO **BAD**)        |

You can have abit more fun here with some [automation](https://fadeevab.com/how-to-setup-qemu-output-to-console-and-automate-using-shell-script/).

# Trying to Boot

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -kernel ./vmlinux -append "console=ttyS0"
```
Anyway, enough playing with chardevs and terminals, we see that the kernel is looking for a blockdev root device
```
[    1.332198] /dev/root: Can't open blockdev
[    1.332485] VFS: Cannot open root device "(null)" or unknown-block(0,0): error -6
[    1.332612] Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
[    1.332827] 0b00         1048575 sr0 
```

So let's try to add a root device
```
dd if=/dev/zero of=rootfs.ext2 bs=1024k count=256
mkfs.ext2 rootfs.ext2
qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -kernel ./vmlinux -append "console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda" -hda rootfs.ext2
```

You can pass in more drives using `-hda`, `-hdb`, `-hdc`, `-hdd`. But it will fill up `/dev/sda,sdb,sdc,sdd` sequentially. Then 
```
(qemu) info block
```

It still crashes, but now it complains there is no init.
```
Kernel panic - not syncing: No working init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel. See Linux Documentation/admin-guide/init.rst for guidance.
```

Let's try writing out own init to get a feel for what the kernel wants.

```
$ mkdir vfs && cd vfs
$ cat << EOF > hello-kernel.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
        printf("Hello, kernel!\n");
        sleep(9999999999999);
}
EOF
$ gcc --static hello-kernel.c -o init
$ find . | cpio -o -H newc | gzip > root.cpio.gz
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -kernel ./vmlinux -append "console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda" -hda rootfk.ext2 -initrd vfs/root.cpio.gz 
```

This shows
```
[    1.504610] Run /init as init process
Hello, kernel!
```

Yay! If you have segmentation fault after typing, make sure you are using `-nographic` (instead of my `$NOGRAPHIC`) because I think when you do your own multiplexing it confuses qemu (probably a bug, would be interesting to investigate).

Interestingly, if we have an `-initrd` we actually don't need a `-hda`. We can just do
```
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ./vmlinux -append "console=ttyS0" -initrd vfs/root.cpio.gz
```

it works fine too. Instead of using our own init, we can use busybox's init. Check out my [minimal kernel blog](https://tch1001.github.io/linux/kernel/2023/01/31/minimal-kernel.html) for details.

Anyway, the main purpose of this blog was to document my understanding of character devices and the many qemu parameters, so I will stop here. Hope you found it useful! Contact me at telegram @tch1001 if you need any help!
