title: "SPOT Talk: Special Relativity"
Categories: [Physics, Olympiad]

I gave a talk on motivating special relativity using math to the Singapore Physics Olympiad Team (SPOT). Here are the [slides](/downloads/SR_SPOT.pdf), and [recording](https://youtu.be/QBHkRiqj8TY). I really enjoyed motivating things from scratch and giving such talks. Let me know what topic you want next!
