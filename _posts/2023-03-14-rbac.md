## Introduction
Why add users to Kubernetes? There are 2 main reasons. 

### Security
You work in a big team of developers. You're the techlead so it's your job to make sure that the team doesn't mess up the cluster. You can't just give everyone admin access. So you need to create a user for each developer. This way, junior developers will not be able to singlehandedly bring down production (that's the job of senior developers!). And you can revoke access if someone leaves the company. 

### CI/CD
While I was setting up CI/CD, I ran into a need to add users. I rent a managed DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster for my personal projects. It uses `doctl` for authentication. Namely, in the `kubeconfig` file,
```yaml
users:
- name: do-sgp1-test-admin
  user:
    exec:
      apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
      args:
      - kubernetes
      - cluster
      - kubeconfig
      - exec-credential
      - --version=v1beta1
      - --context=k8_testing
      - REDACTED 
      command: doctl
      env: null
      interactiveMode: IfAvailable
      provideClusterInfo: false
```
If I copied this kubeconfig file to GitHub actions, it would fail because GitHub actions doesn't have `doctl` installed in the GH actions runner. So I needed to add a user to the cluster that uses a key and cert instead of `doctl`.

## Creating a Private Key and CSR
First, we need to create a private key and a certificate signing request (CSR). The CSR will be signed by the Kubernetes cluster to create a certificate. The certificate will be used to authenticate the user. 

### Private Key
```bash
openssl genrsa -out tom.key 2048
# note whatever comes after CN= (CN stands for Common Name) will be the username of the user in kubernetes
openssl req -new -key tom.key -out tom.csr -subj "/CN=tom"
```

### Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
#### Self Hosted Kubernetes
Note that if you host your **own** kubernetes cluster and have direct SSH access to the master node, you can sign it manually using
```bash
openssl x509 -req -in tom.csr \
  -CA /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt \
  -CAkey /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial \
  -out tom.crt -days 500
```
#### Managed Kubernetes
Otherwise, you don't have direct access to the CA cert so you have to create a CSR to send to the Kubernetes cluster via `kubectl`.
```bash
$ cat tom.csr | base64 | tr -d '\n'
REDACTED_CSR_IN_BASE64
```
Then, create a file called `tom-csr.yaml` with the following contents
```yaml
apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  name: tom-csr
spec:
  groups:
  - system:authenticated
  # I found that using $(cat tom.csr | base64 | tr -d '\n') doesn't work
  # so I just copy pasted the output of the command above
  request: REDACTED_CSR_IN_BASE64
  signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
  usages:
  - digital signature
  - key encipherment
  - client auth
```
After that send it to the Kubernetes API server
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f tom-csr.yaml
$ kubectl get csr
NAME        AGE   SIGNERNAME                            REQUESTOR               REQUESTEDDURATION   CONDITION
tom-csr     68m   kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client   your-email@gmail.com    <none>              Pending
```

## Approve the CSR
Now we have to tell Kubernetes to approve the CSR and give us a certificate.
```bash
$ kubectl certificate approve tom-csr
$ kubectl get csr
NAME        AGE   SIGNERNAME                            REQUESTOR               REQUESTEDDURATION   CONDITION
tom-csr     68m   kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client   your-email@gmail.com    <none>              Approved,Issued
$ k get csr testuser-authentication -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}' | base64 -d > tom.crt 
```
### Add it to a context
If you manage multiple clusters (or have multiple users in a cluster), you will be comfortable with the `KUBECONFIG` file.

The most common way of using `KUBECONFIG` is to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the path of the `kubeconfig` file. 
```bash
$ KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig kubectl get node
NAME                      STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
node-default-pool-mk771   Ready    <none>   70d   v1.70.3
node-default-pool-mk772   Ready    <none>   70d   v1.70.3
$ KUBECONFIG=/another/kubeconfig kubectl get node 
NAME                      STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
some-other-pool           Ready    <none>   10d   v1.70.2
```
A convenient way to manage kubenetes contexts is to use [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx). 

The caveman way to edit `kubeconfig` files is to use `vim`. A more civilised way is to use `kubectl config`.

```bash
$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT NAME         CLUSTER         AUTHINFO     NAMESPACE
*       ctx-name     cluster-name    authinfo     default
        ctx-2        cluster-name    authinfo-2   other-namespace
# if you didn't do --embed-certs then it will be a file path, which might cause portability issues (when copying it to CI/CD, for instance)
$ kubectl config set-credentials tom --client-key=tom.key --client-certificate=tom.crt --embed-certs=true
# if you don't set the namespace, it will default to the namespace in the current context
# namespace could be a source of errors! (see section below on errors)
$ kubectl config set-context tom-context --cluster cluster-name --user=tom --namespace=tom-namespace
Context "tom-context" modified.
$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT NAME         CLUSTER         AUTHINFO     NAMESPACE
*       ctx-name     cluster-name    authinfo     default
        ctx-2        cluster-name    authinfo-2   other-namespace
        tom-context  cluster-name    tom          tom-namespace
$ kubectl config use-context tom-context
$ kubectl config current-context 
tom-context
```
Awesome! so we have created our user. But unfortunately he can't do anything at the moment
```
$ kubectl get pods
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "tom" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```
We need to give him some permissions using roles and role bindings.

## Create Role and Role Binding
There is also a `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` but we will stick to `Role` and `RoleBinding` for now. It's more or less similar too just that `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` are cluster scoped while `Role` and `RoleBinding` are namespace scoped.

### Switching back to admin
We can't create roles and role bindings as tom, so we have to switch back to the admin context
```bash
$ kubectl config use-context ctx-name
$ kubectl config current-context 
ctx-name
```

### Role
```bash
kubectl create role developer --verb=create --verb=get --verb=list --verb=update --verb=delete --resource=pods --resource=pods/exec --resource=pods/attach
```
### Role Binding
```bash
kubectl create rolebinding tom-rolebinding --role=developer --user=tom
```
### Testing
```
$ kubectl config use-context tom-context
$ kubectl config current-context 
tom-context
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
some-prevly-created-pod-fb7dc94b-pr2x8   1/1     Running   7 (73m ago)   136m
```

## Common Errors
### Error from server (Forbidden)
Suppose after you switched context to the newly added user, you try to run `kubectl get pods` and you get the following error
```bash
Error from server (Forbidden): services is forbidden: User "tom" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "default"
```
There are a few things to check
- Role Binding and Roles are namespaced. You can check which namespace you created them in using

```bash
kubectl get role -A
kubectl get rolebinding -A
```

Then check that the context is bound to the correct namespace. Sometimes the namespace is not set.

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts | less -S
CURRENT NAME         CLUSTER         AUTHINFO     NAMESPACE
*       ctx-name     cluster-name    authinfo     default
        ctx-2        cluster-name    authinfo-2   other-namespace
```

- You can check for authorization using

```bash
$ kubectl auth can-i list pods --as tom
yes
$ kubectl auth can-i list pods --as tommy
no
```

- Check the Role. Stare at your previous kubectl command for a while.

```bash
kubectl create role developer --verb=create --verb=get --verb=list --verb=update --verb=delete --resource=pods
```

- Check the Role Binding. Stare at your previous kubectl command for a while. **Especially** the `--user` field. It must match the `CN=` in the CSR.

```bash
kubectl create rolebinding testuser-authentication-rolebinding-2 --role=developer --user=tom
```
