I follow the notation in these [MIT notes](https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/6896sp10/lec5.pdf).

## Definitions

### Each Player's Mixed-Strategy / Distribution of Strategies
Each player $p$ can choose a distribution of strategies / a mixed strategy

$$
\underline{x}_p \in \Delta^{S_p}=\left\{x_p \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{S_p} \mid \sum_
{s_p \in S_p} x_p\left(s_p\right)=1\right\}
$$

Let's unpack this definition. Simply put, this player $p$ is assigning a probability to each strategy (aka action) $s_p \in S_p$. The set $\Delta^{S_p}$ is the set of all such probability distributions, which is a simplex (appears in simplicial homology). $x_p(s_p)$ is the probability that player $p$ chooses strategy $s_p$. We can think of $\underline{x}_p$ as a vector of probabilities, where the index of the vector is the strategy $s_p$.

### All Player's Mixed-Strategy / Distribution of Strategies
Collating all the players' mixed-strategies, we get

$$\underline{x} \in \Pi_{p \in [n]} \Delta^{S_p}$$

where $[n]$ denotes the set of all players $[n] := \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.

### Payoff Function
Each player $p$ has a payoff function $u_p: \Pi_{p \in [n]} S_p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which takes in the distribution of strategies of all players and outputs a real number representing the utility (happiness) of player $p$. 

We also write $u_p(s_p; \underline{x}_{-p})$ to mean the payoff of player $p$ when player $p$ chooses a **pure** strategy $s_p$ and all other players choose mixed strategies $\underline{x}_{-p}$.

### Nash Equilibrium
A Nash equilibrium is a set of mixed strategies $\underline{x}^* \in \Pi_{p \in [n]} \Delta^{S_p}$ such that no player can increase their payoff by unilaterally (which means doing alone) changing their strategy to a pure or mixed stategy. In other words, for all $p \in [n]$ and all $s_p \in S_p$, we have

$$
u_p\left(s_p ; \underline{x}_{-p}^{*}\right) \geq u_p\left(s_p^{\prime} ; \underline{x}_{-p}^{*}\right)
$$

This definition lists down all the pure strategies $s_p$ that player $p$ can choose, but linearity of expectation helps us extend this definition to mixed strategies as well.
