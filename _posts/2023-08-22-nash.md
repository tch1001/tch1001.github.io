I follow the notation in these [MIT notes](https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/6896sp10/lec5.pdf).

### Each Player's Mixed-Strategy / Distribution of Strategies
Each player $p$ can choose a distribution of strategies 

$$
\underline{x}_p \in \Delta^{S_p}=\left\{x_p \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{S_p} \mid \sum_
{s_p \in S_p} x_p\left(s_p\right)=1\right\}
$$

Let's unpack this definition. Simply put, this player $p$ is assigning a probability to each strategy (aka action) $s_p \in S_p$. The set $\Delta^{S_p}$ is the set of all such probability distributions, which is a simplex (appears in simplicial homology). $x_p(s_p)$ is the probability that player $p$ chooses strategy $s_p$. We can think of $\underline{x}_p$ as a vector of probabilities, where the index of the vector is the strategy $s_p$.

### All Player's Mixed-Strategy / Distribution of Strategies
Collating all the players' mixed-strategies, we get

$$\underline{x} \in \Pi_{p \in [n]} \Delta^{S_p}$$

where $[n]$ denotes the set of all players $[n] := \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.
